title: Smooth Scroll and Link Highlighting with jQuery
---

Just a quick post today. I spent a few hours integrating link highlighting and smoothscrolling into my portfolio. It was relatively easy, now that I've gotten comfortable navigating the jQuery syntax.

The method for smooth scroll was thanks to [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0YnVwAuNQI). I'd highly recommend it, assuming you're already familiar with all the core tools it utilizes. What was especially nice was how little was greek to me. I feel confident I can walk thorugh and explain the code step-by-step.

That video's method for link highlighting didn't work for me, so instead I used the Scrollspy component in Bootstrap. Very quick to set up since I already had the id tags in place.

Both required a little bit of touch-ups to work properly, namely offset for both to land on page in a way I liked. I feel today's work flowed *smoothly* and was a good demonstration of how far I've come in navigating web development. I'll guess have to find something a little more challenging :) Onward and upward!

P.S: Also learned the 'rebase' command in git when I needed to integrate the local master into the remote gh-pages branch. Yes, I'm using the terminal!
