My first step in learning programming was to understand what I was getting myself into. Coding has so many options, so many tutorial sites, and so much advice (some of it good) to latch onto. It would have been very easy to pick some and *feel* busy. But, even if my hard work felt like progress, there would be no guarantee it was. I need to choose the right path. More accurately, I needed to know what right paths there were to take.
