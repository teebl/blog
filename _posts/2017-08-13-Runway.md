With so many options in learning code, it would be very easy to pick something, feel busy, and get pretty much nowhere. I needed to feel out the craft, learn my options, and see what I would find to be fulfilling.

So, my first foray into this hobby had nothing to do with coding. My first few days were more of a survey. I'd visit sites that had a focus on self-taught coding, like the forums on [freeCodeCamp](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/i-got-the-job-heres-what-ive-learned-from-the-job-hunt/137709), [github](https://github.com/P1xt/p1xt-guides/blob/master/job-ready.md), and [/r/learnprogramming](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/wiki/faq) on reddit. I would follow the breadcumbs, see where they lead me, and started to document what I found on [trello](https://www.teebl.github.io/images/TrelloLPPage.png).

This helped me figure out how others succeeded, what they got out of what languages, and the lessons they wished they learned sooner. I got a great deal of help from people who had been in my place before, and were kind enough to share their experience.

After a while, I started to discover what I needed, what I liked, and where I need to keep looking. I decided to start with the front-end content. Even if I choose to go somwhere else from there, knowing how to build my own webpages will be a very useful skill. HTML and CSS are a given, but I was still hungry for a challenge. Javascript was both ubiquitious and engaging, there is a lot I can do with it, although I'm still uncertain what path to take regarding in terms of frameworks. I haven't made much in regards to back-end programming. Do I want ot dive in? Or just keep my focus on the front-end. I'll keep it in mind for now, at this point I've developed my path enough that I can make the decision in time.

A frequent recommendation that popped up was the [edX CS50 course](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/course/), and at this point I can see why. It is *hard*. Which I love, and the challenge matches the reward. Learning about the science and logic of computers makes a lot of front-end work seem trivial in comparison. It's a great way to push myself to the point where I'm *almost* hopeless, but then after a few hours of head banging, I pull through, compile the program, and the rush of euphoria flows through as I see the little triangle of hashes really *does* resemble the pyramids in Super Mario Brothers ![mario pyramids](/images/MarioPyramids.png).

edX's CS50 course also teaches me how to utilize the internet to solve a problem I'm lost on. Documentation, stackoverflow, just plain old Google are the bread and butter of diagnosing issues in programming (or so I've heard). Learning where to look for solutions is something I'm sure I'll need now and forever.

With my front-end path sorted out, I am excited to see how far I'll come over the months, and I genuinely can't wait to share some of the things I'll make. So keep an eye out! See you later.
