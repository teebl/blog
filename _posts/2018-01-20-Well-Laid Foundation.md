About five months of time have elapsed since the last blog post. Which is pretty typical for a lot of personal blogs, from what I've seen. I haven't departed from programming, however. In fact I've been quite busy.

In case you've been wondering what I've been up to, today is the first day of my new online portfolio. You can find it at (https://www.teebl.github.io), the former address of this blog. I've put the portfolio to the front-line to show off my skills at webpages, and since this blog was made from a template, it wouldn't really be fair for it to be the first thing to show to potential employers.

As for the new site, it's showing off some of the awesome skills I've learned over the past few months. The webpage itself utilizes bootstrap heavily, a toolkit I've come to know pretty well, and appreciate it's versatility. It's helpful to have something manage the good looks of a project, while I can focus on the nuts-and-bolts stuff under the surface.

Speaking of under the surface, the new website is showing off a couple of web apps I've made: [A Random Quote Generator](https://codepen.io/teebl/full/JMpRrN) and a [Local Weather App](https://codepen.io/teebl/full/KZeOYG). Both projects are part of the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) front end program. freeCodeCamp has been an excellent resource in developing my skills. Interesting projects, with not too much hand holding once you get past the initial tutorials. freeCodeCamp also has an excellent forum, where I can learn from those who've encountered the same problems as myself.

The trello page I've made has grown in size. Not necessarily *disorderly*, mind you, but it is beginning to bulge at the seams. All but the 'Done' category, which has yet to be populated with a single item. I don't think that's due to a lack of conviction on my part, but a circumstance of web development in general.

The learning process in programming has milestones, but not nearly as many finish lines. Take the freeCodeCamp program. Once I 'finish' the Front End Certification, the learning path immediately steps into data visualization, then to back end, and so forth. Even the projects I've completed always have little smudges and imperfections to tweak and polish. The challenges take the form of a stream rather than an ocean.

And I've come to really love the constant evolution of programming. Tackling these problems is a satisfying endeavour, with greater struggles providing even more triumphant victories. I'm stuck on this stuff, and I'll be sure the next post about it will be sooner rather than later this time ;)
