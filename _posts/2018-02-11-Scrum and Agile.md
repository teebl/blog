title: Scrum and Agile
---

My top priority in learning to code is just that: *learning to code*. I focus my time on making things to develop the skill, and in addition it gives me content to add to my portfolio as well. However, it's not lost on me that this isn't all there is programming.

That's why I've been looking at [Agile methodology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development), a way of managing projects and organizing staff structure. Agile seeks to streamline workflow and keep the team focused on the valuable parts of programming. It also aims to give room for the unexpected curveballs that often arise in a project (something I'm very familiar with in my current line of work), and incrementally develop a project with its entirety in mind. This is in contrast to the more traditional methodology called 'waterfall' in which the project would go through a design stage, then a production stage, then finally testing.

With Agile, the testing is constantly getting tweaks to design, while simultaneously recieving tests to track viability along every step.

Agile has a kind of accomplice, known as Scrum. You can find an excellent page describing the dynamic of Scrum [here](https://www.scrummethodology.com)

Scrum's aim is to provide a more concrete framework to allow Agile principles to flourish. A team will have a Scrum Master, to be considered a facilitator of the team members. The Scrum Master's primary goal is to remove as many obstacles as possible from the path to acheiving the goals that have been set out. 

In addition to Scrum master, there will also be a *Product Owner*. This individual's primary focus is to convey what the finish product will be in such a way to the team that they are able to understand and make that vision a reality. Where the Scrum Master focus is on the team, the Product Owner's focus is on the product.

Scrum also prescribes a particular method for meetings. Beginning every *Sprint* (The term for a structured period of time in which goals are set) the team will having a Sprint Planning Meeting, in which the goals are laid out for the coming weeks. A Sprint's intent is to capture and structure an iteration cycle on the project, allowing to keep frequently engaging in 'reality checks' to ensure the project is heading in the right direction. Throughout the Sprint,the team will meet daily work to keep each other well informed on their efforts and needs.

Agile and Scrum are designed to be lean, and become less effective as the team size grows. Micheal James, the author of the aforementioned Scrum Website, suggests a team be no larger than nine.

Personally, I've found Scrum and Agile to be compelling. I know from my experience in woodworking. that I've been more invested in a project if I am with it every step of the way. You are mindful of the effort it took you to complete the initial stages, and you avoid making problems for yourself in the future. I really hope to be part of a team that uses it one day! For now, I'll just make sure I know the ropes.
