Trevor travelled to Ontario from Edmonton in 2015 from his comfortable life watering plants to learn the ways of historical carpentry. After completing the [Heritage Carpentry and Joinery](http://www.algonquincollege.com/perth/program/carpentry-and-joinery-heritage/) course at Algonquin College, he turned his eyes to his next pursuit: programming. Trevor now learns to code part-time, and, using this blog, shares his experience with others.
